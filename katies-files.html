                        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
                            step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                            things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                            was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                            level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                            interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as
                            a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
